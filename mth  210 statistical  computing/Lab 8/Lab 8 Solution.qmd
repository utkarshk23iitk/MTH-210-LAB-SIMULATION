### Problem 1

Minimize \begin{equation*}
        f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
    \end{equation*} subject to \begin{equation*}
        x, y \in [0, 1]
    \end{equation*}

```{r}
# Load the nloptr library
library(nloptr)

# Problem 1: Minimize f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy with x, y in [0, 1]
obj_fun <- function(x) {
  return(x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + 2 * x[1] * x[2])
}

```

The above code defines the multivariate function (objective function) that needs to be minimized.

```{r}
res <- nloptr(
  x0 = c(0.5, 0.5), # initial values
  eval_f = obj_fun,
  lb = c(0, 0),
  ub = c(1, 1),
  opts = list("algorithm" = "NLOPT_GN_ISRES", 
              "xtol_rel" = 1.0e-8, "maxeval" = 1000)
)
```

The variable **res** stores the required output obtained after minimization of the given function.

```{r}
res
```

From the above, we can see that the minimum value of the function for relative tolerance $10^{-8}$ and maximum number of function evaluations as $1000$ is quite close to the actual minimum value of the function i.e. $0$. The function attains $0$ at the extreme i.e. $(0, 0)$.

## Problem 2

Minimize \begin{equation*}
        f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy
    \end{equation*} subject to \begin{equation*}
        x, y \in [0, 1] \text{ and } x + y = 1
    \end{equation*}

```{r}
# Problem 2: Minimize f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy 
# ..with x, y in [0, 1] and x + y = 1
obj_fun <- function(x) {
  return(x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 - 2 * x[1] * x[2])
}

constraint_fun <- function(x) {
  return(x[1] + x[2] - 1) # Equality constraint: x + y - 1 = 0
}
```

The above code defines the multivariate function (objective function) that needs to be minimized.

```{r}
res <- nloptr(
  x0 = c(0.5, 0.5),
  eval_f = obj_fun,
  lb = c(0, 0),
  ub = c(1, 1),
  eval_g_eq = constraint_fun,
  opts = list("algorithm" = "NLOPT_GN_ISRES", 
              "xtol_rel" = 1.0e-8, "maxeval" = 1000)
)
```

The variable **res** stores the required output obtained after minimization of the given function.

```{r}
res
```

From the above, we can see that the minimum value of the function for relative tolerance $10^{-8}$ and maximum number of function evaluations as $1000$ is $0$, which is attained at infinitely many points satisfying $x = y$. But, after the imposition of the equality constraint, we arrive at an unique point where the value of the objective function is minimized which is $( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ and the value is $0$.
